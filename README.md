**Description**
This game is modified version of Clue. 

1. The rooms are laid out in a 3x3 grid with a hallway separating each pair of adjacent rooms.
2. Each hallway only holds one person. If someone is currently in a hallway, you may not
move there.
3. When it is your turn, you don’t need to roll a die.
4. Your options of moving are limited to the following:
* If you are in a room, you may do one of the following:
  * Move through one of the doors to the hallway (if it is not blocked).
  * Take a secret passage to a diagonally opposite room (if there is one) and make a
suggestion.
  * If you were moved to the room by another player making a suggestion, you may, if
you wish, stay in that room and make a suggestion. Otherwise you may move
through a doorway or take a secret passage as described above.
* If you are in a hallway, you must do the following:
  * Move to one of the two rooms accessible from that hallway and make a suggestion.
 
5. If all of the exits are blocked (i.e., there are people in all of the hallways) and you are not in
one of the corner rooms (with a secret passage), and you weren’t moved to the room by
another player making a suggestion, you lose your turn (except for maybe making an
accusation).
6. Your first move must be to the hallway that is adjacent to your home square. The inactive
characters stay in their home squares until they are moved to a room by someone making a
suggestion.
7. Whenever a suggestion is made, the room must be the room the one making the suggestion
is currently in. The suspect in the suggestion is moved to the room in the suggestion.
8. You may make an accusation at any time during your turn.
9. You don’t need to show weapons on the board, since they really don’t do anything (but this
would be a nice feature). But you should show where each of the characters is. 

* Here are the original rules of the (Classic Edition) game. In later versions of the product, some
of the rules may have changed and some features may have been added.
